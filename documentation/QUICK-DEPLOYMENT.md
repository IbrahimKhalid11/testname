🎉 **Your application is now production-ready and accessible worldwide!** 

## 🚀 **Recommended Netlify Settings**

### **Branch to deploy**
```
main
```
*This is the standard default branch. If your repository uses a different branch name (like `master`), use that instead.*

### **Base directory**
```
(leave empty)
```
*Your application files are in the root directory, so no base directory is needed.*

### **Build command**
```
(leave empty)
```
*Your application is a static site (HTML/CSS/JS), so no build process is required. Netlify will serve your files directly.*

### **Publish directory**
```
.
```
*This tells Netlify to serve files from the root directory of your repository.*

### **Functions directory**
```
(leave empty)
```
*You're not using Netlify Functions, so this can be left empty.*

### **Environment variables**
```
(leave empty for now)
```
*Your Supabase configuration is already hardcoded in your `assets/js/supabase/config.js` file, so no environment variables are needed initially.*

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration (Optional)**

If you want to use environment variables for better security later, you can add these:

### **Environment Variables (Optional)**
```
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

*Note: Only add these if you want to move your Supabase keys to environment variables for extra security.*

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Go to Netlify** and click "New site from Git"
2. **Choose GitHub** and select your repository
3. **Configure the build settings** with the values above:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Base directory: (empty)
   - Build command: (empty)
   - Publish directory: `.`
   - Functions directory: (empty)
   - Environment variables: (empty for now)
4. **Click "Deploy site"**

## ✅ **What Happens Next**

- Netlify will detect your `netlify.toml` file and use those settings
- Your site will be built and deployed automatically
- You'll get a URL like `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- All your pages will be accessible and functional

## 🔍 **Verification Checklist**

After deployment, verify these work:
- ✅ **Homepage loads**: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- ✅ **Login works**: Navigate to login page
- ✅ **All pages accessible**: Reports, KPIs, Calendar, etc.
- ✅ **File uploads work**: Test uploading a report
- ✅ **Database operations**: Create/edit/delete records

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **If you get a 404 error:**
- Check that your `netlify.toml` file is in the root directory
- Verify the publish directory is set to `.`

### **If authentication doesn't work:**
- Check your Supabase project settings
- Verify the CORS settings in your Supabase dashboard

### **If file uploads fail:**
- Check your Supabase storage bucket permissions
- Verify the storage bucket exists and is public

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Start simple**: Use the basic settings first, then add environment variables later
2. **Test thoroughly**: Check all major features after deployment
3. **Monitor logs**: Use Netlify's function logs to debug any issues
4. **Set up analytics**: Enable Netlify Analytics to track usage

Your application should deploy successfully with these settings! The `netlify.toml` file I created will handle most of the configuration automatically, so even if you miss some settings, it should still work.
