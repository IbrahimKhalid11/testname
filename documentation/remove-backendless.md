# Backendless Removal Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for removing Backendless integration from the application. Since we are now fully migrated to Supabase, the Backendless code can be safely removed.

## Files to Remove

The following files are no longer needed and can be safely removed:

1. `assets/js/backendless/config.js`
2. `assets/js/backendless/auth.js`
3. All other files in the `assets/js/backendless/` directory
4. `auth-integration-manager.js` (replaced by `supabase-auth-manager.js`)
5. `login-with-supabase.html` (replaced by `login-supabase.html`)

## Files to Update

The following files need to be updated to remove Backendless references:

1. `login.html` - Replace with a redirect to `login-supabase.html`
2. Any HTML files that load Backendless scripts
3. Any JavaScript files that reference Backendless services

## Authentication Updates

The authentication system has been updated to use only Supabase. The new flow is:

1. `login-supabase.html` - Primary login page
2. `supabase-auth-manager.js` - Authentication management
3. `assets/js/supabase/auth.js` - Supabase authentication service

## Next Steps

1. Update any page that includes Backendless scripts to use Supabase instead
2. Update any integration code that still references Backendless
3. Update documentation to reflect the Supabase-only architecture

## Testing

After removing Backendless code:

1. Test authentication flow with existing Supabase users
2. Test data synchronization
3. Test file storage and retrieval
4. Verify that no console errors appear related to missing Backendless components
