### 2. Local Storage Integration

#### A. Data Structure Updates
- Added new collections to `initializeDatabase()` function in `assets/js/data.js`
- Included sample data for all new tables with realistic examples
- Maintained compatibility with existing data structure

#### B. Database Access Methods
Added comprehensive methods to the `DB` object:

**Core Methods:**
- `getScorecardsByDepartment(department)` - Filter scorecards by department
- `getKPIsByScorecard(scorecardId)` - Get KPIs for a specific scorecard
- `getScorecardAssignment(userId, scorecardId, month, year)` - Get user assignment
- `getScorecardResult(userId, scorecardId, month, year)` - Get user results

**Calculation Methods:**
- `calculateKPIScore(kpi, actualValue)` - Calculate individual KPI score (0-100%)
- `calculateScorecardScore(kpis, kpiValues)` - Calculate weighted total score

**Permission Methods:**
- `canEditScorecard(userId, scorecardId, month, year)` - Check edit permissions
- `getUserScorecardAssignments(userId, month, year)` - Get user's assignments

**Utility Methods:**
- `getLinkedReportTypes(kpiId)` - Get report types linked to a KPI
- `getScorecardResultsByDepartment(department, month, year)` - Get department results

### 3. Supabase Integration

#### A. Data Service Updates
- Added specialized methods to `SupabaseData` class in `assets/js/supabase/data.js`
- Methods include: `getScorecards()`, `getKPIs()`, `getScorecardAssignments()`, `getScorecardResults()`
- Added filtering methods: `getKPIsByScorecard()`, `getScorecardsByDepartment()`
- Added assignment and result retrieval methods

#### B. Integration Manager Updates
- Updated `syncFromSupabase()` to include new tables in parallel data fetching
- Updated `syncToSupabase()` to sync new tables to Supabase
- Updated table mapping for CRUD operations
- Enhanced logging to include scorecard data counts

### 4. Database Schema

#### A. SQL Schema File
Created `scorecard-schema.sql` with:
- Complete table definitions with proper constraints
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Database functions for score calculations
- Triggers for automatic score updates

#### B. RLS Policies
Implemented comprehensive security policies:
- **Scorecards**: Users can view scorecards from their departments, admins can manage all
- **KPIs**: Users can view KPIs from their department scorecards, admins can manage all
- **Assignments**: Users can view their own assignments and department assignments
- **Results**: Users can view/update their own results, view department results

#### C. Database Functions
- `calculate_kpi_score(target_value, actual_value)` - Calculate KPI percentage
- `calculate_scorecard_total_score(scorecard_id, kpi_values)` - Calculate weighted total
- `update_scorecard_total_score()` - Trigger function for automatic updates

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

#### A. Test Page
Created `test-scorecard-data-models.html` with comprehensive testing:
- Local storage data model tests
- Supabase integration tests
- Scorecard functionality tests
- Score calculation tests
- User assignment tests
- Department filtering tests

#### B. Test Coverage
- Data model validation
- CRUD operations testing
- Score calculation accuracy
- Permission system testing
- Integration with existing user/department structure

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

### 1. Existing User/Department Structure
- **No Changes Required**: New system leverages existing user and department data
- **Permission Integration**: Uses existing role-based permissions and department assignments
- **Data Consistency**: Maintains referential integrity with existing tables

### 2. Report Type Linking
- **KPI-Report Integration**: KPIs can be linked to specific report types
- **Data Flow**: Reports â†’ KPIs â†’ Scorecards â†’ Results
- **Future Enhancement**: Automatic KPI value extraction from reports

### 3. Modular Design
- **Independent Operation**: Scorecard system can operate independently
- **Optional Integration**: Can be enabled/disabled without affecting existing features
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features and integrations

## ðŸ“Š Sample Data Included

### 1. Sample Scorecards
- **Sales Performance Scorecard**: 3 KPIs (Revenue, Customer Acquisition, Conversion Rate)
- **Marketing Effectiveness Scorecard**: 2 KPIs (Social Media Engagement, Campaign ROI)
- **IT Operations Scorecard**: 2 KPIs (Server Uptime, Response Time)

### 2. Sample Assignments
- John Doe assigned to Sales scorecard (June 2025)
- Jane Smith assigned to Marketing scorecard (June 2025)
- Admin User assigned to IT scorecard (June 2025)

### 3. Sample Results
- Realistic KPI values with calculated scores
- Demonstrates score calculation logic
- Shows data relationships and integrity

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Phase 2)

### 1. Scorecard Designer Page
- Admin-only interface for creating/editing scorecards
- KPI management with weights and targets
- Report type linking interface

### 2. Assignment Management
- User assignment interface
