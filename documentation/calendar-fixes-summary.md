# Calendar Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. HR Manager Approval Tasks Missing
**Problem**: HR Manager approval tasks were not being generated in the calendar.

**Root Cause**: The task generation logic was only creating approval tasks if the current user had approval permissions (`canApprove` was true). This meant that if the current user wasn't an HR Manager, no approval tasks would be created for anyone.

**Fix**: Modified the task generation logic to always create approval tasks for HR Managers, regardless of the current user's permissions.

**Code Changes**:
- In `generateScorecardTasksForMonth()` method, changed from:
  ```javascript
  if (canApprove) {
      // Create approve task
  }
  ```
- To:
  ```javascript
  // Always create for HR Manager (regardless of current user)
  const hrDepartment = departments.find(dept => dept.name === 'HR');
  if (hrDepartment) {
      // Create approve task
  }
  ```

### 2. Submit Button Not Working
**Problem**: The submit button was calling a placeholder method that only showed an alert and didn't save data to Supabase.

**Root Cause**: The `submitScorecard()` method was just a TODO placeholder.

**Fix**: Implemented full submit functionality that:
- Validates user permissions
- Collects KPI values from the form
- Saves data to Supabase with 'submitted' status
- Updates the calendar to reflect changes

**Code Changes**:
- Replaced placeholder `submitScorecard()` method with full implementation
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Integrated with Supabase data service
- Added status tracking and user attribution

### 3. Approve Button Not Working
**Problem**: The approve button was calling a placeholder method that only showed an alert and didn't update the database.

**Root Cause**: The `approveScorecard()` method was just a TODO placeholder.

**Fix**: Implemented full approve functionality that:
- Validates user permissions (HR Manager only)
- Finds submitted scorecard results
- Updates status to 'approved'
- Saves changes to Supabase
- Updates the calendar to reflect changes

**Code Changes**:
- Replaced placeholder `approveScorecard()` method with full implementation
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Integrated with Supabase data service
- Added approval tracking and user attribution

### 4. Submit Task Generation Issue
**Problem**: Submit tasks were only created if the current user had submit permissions.

**Root Cause**: Similar to the approval task issue, the logic was checking current user permissions instead of always creating tasks for department managers.

**Fix**: Modified task generation to always create submit tasks for department managers.

**Code Changes**:
- In `generateScorecardTasksForMonth()` method, changed from:
  ```javascript
  if (canSubmit) {
      // Create submit task
  }
  ```
- To:
  ```javascript
  // Always create for department manager (regardless of current user)
  const departmentManager = await this.getResponsiblePerson(scorecard.department);
  if (departmentManager && departmentManager !== 'Unassigned') {
      // Create submit task
  }
  ```

## How the Fixes Work

### Task Generation Flow
1. **Fill Tasks**: Created for responsible persons who can enter KPI values
2. **Submit Tasks**: Always created for department managers (regardless of current user)
3. **Approve Tasks**: Always created for HR department (regardless of current user)

### Submit Flow
1. User clicks "Submit for Approval" button
2. System validates user permissions
3. System collects KPI values from form inputs
4. System creates/updates scorecard result with 'submitted' status
5. System saves to Supabase
6. System refreshes calendar to show updated status

### Approve Flow
1. HR Manager clicks "Approve Scorecard" button
2. System validates user is HR Manager
3. System finds submitted scorecard result for current period
4. System updates status to 'approved'
5. System saves to Supabase
6. System refreshes calendar to show updated status

## Testing

A test page (`test-calendar-fixes.html`) has been created to verify:
- Task generation works correctly
- Submit functionality works
- Approve functionality works
- User permissions are correctly applied

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **HR Managers** should see approval tasks for all scorecards
2. **Department Managers** should see submit tasks for their department's scorecards
3. **Responsible Persons** should see fill tasks for their assigned scorecards
4. **Submit button** should save data to Supabase and update status
5. **Approve button** should update status to approved in Supabase

## Files Modified

## Notes
