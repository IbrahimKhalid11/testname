# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deploy to GitHub Pages (Alternative to Netlify)

If Netlify is having connection issues, GitHub Pages is an excellent free alternative.

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Settings" tab**
3. **Scroll down to "Pages" section**
4. **Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"**
5. **Choose "master" branch**
6. **Select "/ (root)" folder**
7. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Your Site is Live!

- Your site will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME`
- It may take a few minutes to deploy
- You'll see a green checkmark when deployment is complete

### Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In the Pages settings, add your custom domain**
2. **Update your DNS settings** as instructed
3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (can take up to 24 hours)

## âœ… GitHub Pages Advantages

- âœ… **Free hosting** with unlimited bandwidth
- âœ… **Automatic HTTPS** included
- âœ… **Direct Git integration** - no third-party service needed
- âœ… **Custom domains** supported
- âœ… **No connection issues** like Netlify

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Your existing `netlify.toml` file will be ignored by GitHub Pages, but that's fine since GitHub Pages serves static files directly.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- âœ… **Homepage loads**: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`
- âœ… **All pages accessible**: Reports, KPIs, Calendar, etc.
- âœ… **Supabase integration works**: Login, file uploads, database operations
- âœ… **No CORS errors**: Check browser console

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If pages don't load:
- Check that your repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)
- Verify the branch name is correct (master, not main)
- Wait a few minutes for initial deployment

### If Supabase doesn't work:
- Check your Supabase project settings
- Verify CORS settings in Supabase dashboard
- Ensure your Supabase keys are correct
